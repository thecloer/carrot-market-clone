This project is a clone of [Karrot Market](https://karrotmarket.com/), a popular second-hand trading platform. While it was initially inspired by the [online course](https://nomadcoders.co/carrot-market), the implementation differs significantly in many areas.

Although the course provided a solid foundation, I have customized and improved various aspects of the project, including the project structure, responsive UI components, and overall implementation, to better reflect my approach and preferences.
